# Time_just_ran_out

## Description
The goal of this weeks challenge is to build a webpage (from scratch) that will allow a user to take a timed test and use javascript to build this. The ideal would be that with this timed test when the timer starts the user is presented with a question, should they answer the question incorrectly time is then taken away from the test. On a successful answer to the test question a new question will be presented (timer still running). All of the questions must be answered or the time will run to zero. The user will also have the ability to save their initials into the game and their score.

## User Story

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

## Testing
Much of the testing that I went through was using console.log to check if functions were being called. When I was building the initial JS logic I started over as my organizational through process changed and why I left sections of code greyed out. one area of struggle I had was getting the page of the high scores to populate like the questions, what I changed mindset in doing was having the highscores section be its own html and js linked together in the index page.
